In FP its easier to address goals: 
  1. reusable code, 
  2. highly abstraction 
  3. formal verification (spec sharp/code contracts)

FP is "petradish" => easier to test ideas and import them into oop languages.

What is FP?
  Programming with mathematical functions! 
    => With Haskell you are forced to not cheat 
    => provides more clear result

Imperative vs Functional => sum[1..10]
  BENEFITS of FP:
  - composed of expressions => each subexpression is indepented of its context
  - testable & lookable separate and than can be used to compose it together
    in some higher
    
History: 
  - Lambda calculus from 30s, Theory of functions
  - Lisp in 50s, but has mutable state, depends on Von Neumann arch.
  - ISWIM (Peter Landin) in 60s - pure functional language
    - DSL => you can define semantics of DSL in Functional language
  - 70s FP language => HOF & reasoning about programming
  - ML - 1st modern FL - type inference, polymorphic types/generic
  - *David Turner* - Miranda system - lazy FPL
    - SKI combinators
    - added types in FP => errors dissapear and compiles fetches them
      - static typing when possible vs dynamic when neccessery
      - Scheme is dynamically typed but currently adding types and contracts
  - in 87 Haskell => standard for lazy, purelly FPL
    - directlly inspired LINQ, C#, F#,...

Pure lazy FP, example:
  Quick sort
    f [] = []
    f (x:xs) = f ys ++ [x] ++ f zs
               where
                  ys = [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
                  zs = [b | b <- xs, b > x]

Functions from Prelude <=> BCL
  - head [1, 2, 3, 4] => 1
  - [1, 2, 3, 4] !! 2 => 3
  - tail [1, 2, 3, 4] => [2, 3, 4]
  - take 2 [1, 2, 3, 4] => [1, 2] 
  - drop 2 [1, 2, 3, 4] => [2, 3, 4]
  - sum []
  - length []
  - product [2,3,4] => 12
  - reverse []
  - [1,2,3] ++ [3,4,5] => [1,2,3,3,4,5]


C#: RECEIVER.method(a, b, c) => receiver most important
Haskell: METHOD receiver a b c => dynamic dispatch/pattern matching
  based on dynamic type you try to call different method

Everything is done on LIST

Fluent programming in OOP cause IDE drives you, in FP its all on you.
In maths => Operator you use the most you give it least space, ex. dot
In haskel => function application => space 
  (takes least space and binds most/highest priority - noiceless syntax)
  ex. f a b + c*d

Function applications (Math - Haskell):
  - f(x) => f x
  - f(x,y) => f x y
  - f(g(x)) => f (g x)
  - f(x,g(y)) => f x (g y)
  - f(x)g(z) => f x * g y
  - composition: f(g(x)) => (f.g)x = f.g

Script files for defining own functions => .hs file

Unit tests in OOP => setup -> run tests -> tear down everything
  (to run method it needs to live in context)
vs QuickCheck - isolation of life, no need for global state

Because of lazy evaluation => take n [1..] => essential for compositional expressions

Infix operator creation with back quotes

[Naming conventions]  
PascalCase = typenames
camelCase = variables and functions

Hungarian notation => if number => x; if list => xs; if flatten => xss

[Types]
  - name for collection of related values => Bool => 2 logical values: False/True
  - expression evaluation (expr e produces value of type t) => e :: t
  - by type inference every expression has type auto calculated on compilation
    - type errors found in compile time (safer and faster)
  BCL Types: Bool, Char, String, Int, Integer, Float
  List => sequence of values of same type
    - ['a','c','s'] :: [Char]
    - [1,2,3,4] :: [Int] => same constructors "[" and "]" for type and value
    - list of arbitraty types allowed also: [[[Char]]]
  Tuples => (1,True,'c') :: (Int,Bool,Char)

  Function Types
    - mapping from values of one type to values of another type:
    - not :: Bool -> Bool
    - isDigit :: Char -> Bool
    - ex. \x -> ...x...:: t1 -> t2
    - vs C#:
      1. Func<T> => () -> T
      2. Func<S,T> => S -> T
      3. Action<T> => T -> () //makes sense if "IO ()" in Monads

    - actions with pair arguments
      add :: (Int, Int) -> Int
    - curryed actions (Higher order function - takes argument one by one): 
      add :: Int -> (Int -> Int) 
        ex.
          add x y = x+y
          add' x = \y -> x+y
          add'' = \x -> (\y -> x+y)

          mult x y z = x*y*z
          mult :: Int -> (Int -> (Int -> Int))

    - Type construction (arrow) is right associative:
        int -> int -> int -> int -> int (is same as) int -> (int -> (int -> int))
    - Function application is associate to left!:
        mult x y z = ((mult x)y)z

Why currying?
  - partial applying => f ::int -> int -> int (now apply 5)
                    => f5 :: int -> int
                    => (f5)3 :: int
                    => f 5 3 :: int

Polymorphic functions
  - length :: [a] -> Int (list of arbitrary types as input)
  - fst :: (a,b) -> a
  - zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
  - id :: a -> a 
  - head :: [a] -> a
  - take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

Classes
  - sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
  Num means that a is constraint to Num typeclass
  
  Built in typeclasses/interfaces
    - Num = numeric type
    - Eq = equality type
    - Ord = ordered types

    ex. (+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
        (==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
        (<) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
